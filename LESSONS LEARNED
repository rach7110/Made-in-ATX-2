*******************CHALLENGE:***************************
Pulling data from an API and storing to the database - where's the best place for the code?
**************************CODE:*************************
require 'open-uri'
require 'json'

json_file = JSON.parse(open("http://api.crunchbase.com/v/1/search.js?geo=78701&range=15&page=1&api_key=bxqwjskgyrg2hjykcrc6dbpy").read)
@crunchbase_companies = json_file["results"] 

@crunchbase_companies.each do |crunchbase_company|
	@company = Company.create(:name => crunchbase_company["name"], :category_code => crunchbase_company["category_code"], :homepage_url => crunchbase_company["homepage_url"], :overview => crunchbase_company["overview"], :image => crunchbase_company["image"])
end
***********************ATTEMPTS/LESSONS LEARNED**************************
Attempt 1: 
	Controller (placed in the companies controller under the index action) 
Lesson Learned 1:
	The root to: (homepage) is set to companies#index. Ultimately, this causes several issues:
	1) It slows down the applicaiton b/c each time the homepage is refreshed, it's making a request to the API and pulling the data. 
	2) Each time the index action is run, it is making new instances with the data from the API. So there will be repeats of the same data.

Attempt 2:
	Seed file
Lesson Learned 2: 
	The seed data has to be manually added to the database through the command line by running bundle exec rake db:seed. Also, The seed data will not be deployed Heroku (?)

Attempt 3:
	Model
Lesson Learned 3: 
	It works in the model just like tin the controller. I'm not sure what the difference is. It was still pulling repeatedly, so I added a control statement using unless. 
	Code:
	unless @company.present? 
		crunchbase_companies.each do |crunchbase_company|
  			@company = Company.create(:name => crunchbase_company["name"], :category_code => crunchbase_company["category_code"], :homepage_url => crunchbase_company["homepage_url"], :overview => crunchbase_company["overview"], :image => crunchbase_company["image"])
    	end
 	end
